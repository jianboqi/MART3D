# MART3D

**MART3D** is a **M**ulti-l**A**yer heterogeneous **3D** **R**adiative **T**rasnfer framework for forest reflectance simulations based on the 3D radiative transfer model LESS (http://lessrt.org/). Therefore, MART3D actually provides a simple interface to the sophisticated 3D RT model. With MART3D, we can input some simple parameters instead of explicitly creating 3D scenes, e.g., leaf area index, trunk height, crown diameter and grass LAI. These parameters are then used by MART3D to generate heterogeneous 3D scenes automatically, based on which LESS simulates BRF with accurate 3D radiative transfer modeling.
